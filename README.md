# Wallet App

## Description
The Wallet App is a simple command-line application written in four languages, which are C++, Python, Java and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their wallet balance, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer funds to another wallet, take a loan, and exit the application.

### Features

1. **Display Balance**: View the current balance in the wallet.
2. **Deposit Money**: Add money to the wallet.
3. **Withdraw Money**: Remove money from the wallet, if sufficient funds are available.
4. **Transfer Money**: Send money to another wallet.
5. **Take a Loan**: Take a loan if the wallet balance equals **zero** (up to a minimum limit of -200000).
6. **Exit**: Quit the wallet application.

#### WIP
This application should have been contained more asset apart from Money, such as Card ID, Bank Card, Visit Card, Photo ID, Driver License...

To implement those features, we need to inherit the **Wallet** class.
